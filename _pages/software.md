I have developed the following Shiny apps to automate the methodology proposed with my collaborators in our papers.

* [https://luke-hagar.shinyapps.io/CPM_App/](https://luke-hagar.shinyapps.io/CPM_App/)
This app allows practitioners to perform Bayesian estimation using comparative probability metrics (CPMs) without needing to manually implement the underlying computational details themselves.

* [https://luke-hagar.shinyapps.io/SSD_App/](https://luke-hagar.shinyapps.io/SSD_App/)
This app automates the sample size determination methodology that practitioners can use to determine how much data are required to calculate trustworthy CPMs for two-group comparisons.

* [https://luke-hagar.shinyapps.io/Baseline_PoA_App/](https://luke-hagar.shinyapps.io/Baseline_PoA_App/)
This app allows practitioners to compare the distributional characteristics of new and reference samples using a baseline with the probability of agreement (PoA).

* [https://luke-hagar.shinyapps.io/Ordinal_Priors/](https://luke-hagar.shinyapps.io/Ordinal_Priors/)
This app allows practitioners to specify informative priors for ordinal models using an interactive graphical interface that provides iterative feedback.
