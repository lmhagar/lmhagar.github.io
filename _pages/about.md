Hi, I'm Luke! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health at McGill University, where I work under the supervision of [Dr. Shirin Golchi](https://sgolchi.research.mcgill.ca/). Before joining McGill, I completed a PhD in Statistics at the University of Waterloo, supervised by [Dr. Nathaniel Stevens](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/nstevens/home). My research focuses on developing efficient, theory-driven methods for study design, with applications to hypothesis testing and sample size determination.

Study design often relies on computer simulations to explore sampling distributions, which can be computationally intensive. My work introduces novel techniques to nonuniformly target specific segments of these distributions and to estimate distributions for new design scenarios using results from previously considered settings. These methods drastically reduce the computational burden of study design, making simulation-based methods more accessible.

At McGill, my work emphasizes clinical applications, particularly the development of statistical methods to efficiently design Bayesian clinical trials. I am also participating in a fellowship with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Oncology Center of Excellence to expand my expertise in these areas. While my current focus is on clinical research, I remain interested in applying efficient experimental design methods in business and industrial contexts.

I have taught both undergraduate and graduate courses as a Lecturer at McGill and Waterloo. At Waterloo, I worked with the Centre for Teaching Excellence to help graduate students develop their teaching skills. My experience as a Graduate Student Consultant with their Statistical Consulting and Survey Research Unit honed my ability to support interdisciplinary research -- skills I later applied in collaborations with linguistics researchers and an applied research project with Airbnb’s data science team.
