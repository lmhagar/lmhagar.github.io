Hi, I'm Luke! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in Biostatistics at McGill University, working with [Dr. Shirin Golchi](https://sgolchi.research.mcgill.ca/). Before this, I completed a PhD in Statistics at the University of Waterloo with [Dr. Nathaniel Stevens](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/nstevens/home). My research develops efficient, theory-driven methods for study design. By targeting specific segments of sampling distributions and economically reusing simulation results, my work reduces the computational burden of simulation-based design.

At McGill, I develop efficient methods to design Bayesian clinical trials. I am also expanding my clinical expertise through a fellowship with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Oncology Center of Excellence. Beyond clinical statistics, I am interested in creating economical methods for experimental design in business and industry.

I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses at McGill and Waterloo and worked with Waterloo’s Centre for Teaching Excellence to support graduate teaching development. As a Graduate Student Consultant, I honed skills supporting interdisciplinary research that I later applied in collaborations with linguistics researchers and Airbnb’s data science team.

I’m active in professional societies, co-leading the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC)’s Community Connections initiative and serving as Chair-Elect of the American Society for Quality’s Chemical Process and Industries Division. Previously, I chaired the SSC’s Student and Recent Graduate Committee and co-chaired the 2023 Canadian Statistics Student Conference.
