Hi, I'm Luke! I am a Research Officer with The University of Queensland’s [Clinical Trials Capability](https://clinical-research.centre.uq.edu.au/ultra) (ULTRA). Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at McGill University, following the completion of my PhD in Statistics at the University of Waterloo in 2024. 

My research develops efficient, theory-driven methods to reduce the computational burden of simulation-based design. My methods have been published in leading venues, including the *Journal of the American Statistical Association* and the *Journal of Business and Economic Statistics*. Much of my recent work has been motivated by Bayesian clinical trials, building on expertise from a fellowship with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Oncology Center of Excellence. Beyond clinical statistics, I am interested in creating economical methods for experimental design in business and industrial settings.

I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses at McGill and Waterloo and worked with Waterloo’s Centre for Teaching Excellence to support graduate teaching development. As a Graduate Student Consultant, I honed skills supporting interdisciplinary research that I later applied in collaborations with linguistics researchers and Airbnb’s data science team.

I am actively engaged in the statistical community. I currently co-lead the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC)’s Community Connections initiative and serve as Chair of the American Society for Quality’s Chemical Process and Industries Division. Previously, I chaired the SSC’s Student and Recent Graduate Committee and co-chaired the 2023 Canadian Statistics Student Conference.
