Hi, I'm Luke! In September, I will be a Postdoctoral Scholar supervised by [Dr. Shirin Golchi](https://sgolchi.research.mcgill.ca/) in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health at McGill University. I recently completed a PhD in Statistics at the University of Waterloo, under the supervision of [Dr. Nathaniel Stevens](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/nstevens/home). Previously, I earned an MMATH in Statistics (2021) and a BMATH in Mathematical Optimization & Statistics (2020) from the University of Waterloo.

At the University of Waterloo, I took on several roles, including Sessional Lecturer in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, TA Workshop Facilitator with the Centre for Teaching Excellence, and Graduate Student Consultant at the Statistical Consulting and Survey Research Unit. I recently chaired the Statistical Society of Canada's Student and Research Graduate Committee and co-chaired their 2023 Canadian Statistics Student Conference. I also volunteer with the American Society for Quality's Chemical Process and Industries Division.

My research interests include experimental design, efficient sampling techniques, hypothesis testing, Bayesian methods, and computational inference. My thesis explores scalable methods for study design with sampling distribution segments, with an emphasis on sample size determination for hypothesis testing. These methods significantly reduce the runtime of simulation-based design procedures. Looking ahead, I aim to extend these techniques to more complex settings in my postdoctoral work and beyond.
