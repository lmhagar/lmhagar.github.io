ðŸŽ“ I am a PhD Candidate in Statistics at the University of Waterloo (anticipated completion date: August 2024). I currently work under the supervision of Dr. Nathaniel Stevens. Previously, I earned an MMATH in Statistics (2021) and a BMATH in Mathematical Optimization & Statistics (2020) from UW.

ðŸ“š At the University of Waterloo, I worked as a Sessional Lecturer with the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, a TA Workshop Facilitator with the Centre for Teaching Excellence, and a Graduate Student Consultant at the Statistical Consulting and Collaborative Research Unit. I am also a member of the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC). I currently chair the SSC's Student and Research Graduate Committee, and I co-chaired the SSC's 2023 Canadian Statistics Student Conference.

ðŸ”¬ My research interests include experimental design, efficient sampling techniques, hypothesis testing, Bayesian methods, and computational inference. My thesis explores scalable methods for study design with sampling distribution segments, with an emphasis on sample size determination for hypothesis testing. These methods can reduce the runtime of simulation-based design methods by several orders of magnitude. I hope to extend these methods to more complex designs in my postdoctoral work, for which I have received funding.
