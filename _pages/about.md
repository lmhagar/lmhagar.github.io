ðŸŽ“ I am currently a PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of Waterloo (UW) in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, under the supervision of Dr. Nathaniel Stevens. I anticipate completely my PhD in Summer 2024, and I have received postdoctoral funding. I also earned an MMATH in Statistics (2021) and a BMATH in Mathematical Optimization & Statistics (2020) from UW.

I have worked as a TA Workshop Facilitator at UW's Centre for Teaching Excellence and a Sessional Lecturer with the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science. I have also worked as a graduate student consultant at the Statistical Consulting and Collaborative Research Unit at UW. I am a member of the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC). I currently chair the SSC's Student and Research Graduate Committee (SARGC), and I co-chaired the SSC's 2023 Canadian Statistics Student Conference (CSSC).

My current research interests include experimental design, efficient sampling techniques, hypothesis testing, Bayesian methods, and computational inference. My thesis explores scalable methods for study design facilitated with sampling distribution segments, with an emphasis on hypothesis testing and interval hypotheses. These methods can reduce the runtime of simulation-based design methods by several orders of magnitude without relying on large-scale computing resources. I hope to extend these methods to more complex designs in his postdoctoral work.
