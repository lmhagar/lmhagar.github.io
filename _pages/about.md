Hi, I'm Luke! In September, I will begin working with the University of Queensland’s [Clinical Trials Capability](https://clinical-research.centre.uq.edu.au/ultra) as a Research Officer. I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in Biostatistics at McGill University, working with [Shirin Golchi](https://sgolchi.research.mcgill.ca/). Before this, I completed a PhD in Statistics at the University of Waterloo with [Nathaniel Stevens](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/nstevens/home). My research develops efficient, theory-driven methods to reduce the computational burden of simulation-based design.

At McGill, I develop efficient methods to design Bayesian clinical trials. I have also expanded my clinical expertise through a fellowship with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Oncology Center of Excellence. Beyond clinical statistics, I am interested in creating economical methods for experimental design in business and industrial settings.

I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses at McGill and Waterloo and worked with Waterloo’s Centre for Teaching Excellence to support graduate teaching development. As a Graduate Student Consultant, I honed skills supporting interdisciplinary research that I later applied in collaborations with linguistics researchers and Airbnb’s data science team.

I’m active in professional societies, co-leading the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC)’s Community Connections initiative and serving as Chair-Elect of the American Society for Quality’s Chemical Process and Industries Division. Previously, I chaired the SSC’s Student and Recent Graduate Committee and co-chaired the 2023 Canadian Statistics Student Conference.
