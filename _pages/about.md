ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Luke! I'm a PhD Candidate in Statistics at the University of Waterloo, with my defense scheduled for July 2024. I currently work under the supervision of Dr. Nathaniel Stevens. Previously, I earned an MMATH in Statistics (2021) and a BMATH in Mathematical Optimization & Statistics (2020) from the University of Waterloo.

ðŸ“š At the University of Waterloo, I took on several roles, including Sessional Lecturer in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, TA Workshop Facilitator with the Centre for Teaching Excellence, and Graduate Student Consultant at the Statistical Consulting and Collaborative Research Unit. I am an active member of the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC). I recently currently chaired the SSC's Student and Research Graduate Committee and co-chaired the SSC's 2023 Canadian Statistics Student Conference.

ðŸ”¬ My research interests include experimental design, efficient sampling techniques, hypothesis testing, Bayesian methods, and computational inference. My thesis explores scalable methods for study design with sampling distribution segments, with an emphasis on sample size determination for hypothesis testing. These innovative methods significantly reduce the runtime of simulation-based design procedures. Looking ahead, I aim to extend these techniques to more complex designs in my postdoctoral work, for which I have secured funding.
